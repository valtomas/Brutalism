				BRUTALISM
			</div> 

			<div class="introText"> 
				Born out of England's need to quickly rebuild after World War II, beloved of critics and the architectural elite but despised by pretty much everyone else, no style of architecture has been more controversial than Brutalism.
			
				Below a few personal opinions on why I belive Brutalism is great:
			</div> 
			
			<div class="opinions">
				<li> Brutalism used material to create a robust frame that was offered to the public. It  was the last time architecture was a truly public endeavor, ever since private interests have been on the rise.</li>
				<li> Unconcerned with ornamentation, their primary concrete materiality forces them to rely on form and depth to create composition with light and shadows.</li>
				<li> Buildings today tend to be tight-skinned with a thin layer between inside and out; these buildings look and feel solid. </li>
				<li> It unites the monumentality and lofty aspirations of traditional architecture with the social intentions of modernism. Monuments built not for kings, but for people.</li>
				<li> Universities, governments, and banks favored brutalism, since the movement  meant to show power as opposed to wealth and opulence, they show strength and institution. </li>
